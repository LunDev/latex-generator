This project contains a structure generator for LaTeX Assignments.

Note: There are better ways for organizing LaTeX projects, but this one is one of simplest I know of (especially with beginners in mind).

Documentation is available at the top of generator.sh

Contains a starting point for LaTex projects as well (basic gitignore & vscode configuration).
